# I'm Lionel

I'm an astronomer and research fellow at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (Flatiron Institute, New York).

- âœ¨ I develop computational methods and open-source software to study [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet) and their host stars.
- ðŸ”­ I help operate and maintain [remote telescopes](https://www.speculoos.uliege.be/cms/c_4259452/en/speculoos?id=c_4259452) across the globe.
- ðŸŒŒ I build data pipelines and intuitive web tools to turn raw observations into scientific discoveries.
